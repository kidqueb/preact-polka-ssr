# Preact/Polka SSR

## Todo:
* [x] Install `webpack-cli`
* [x] Webpack compiling server and client seperately
* [ ] Double check babel level (async/await, class methods, etc..)
* [x] Route based code splitting
* [ ] Sass. CSS Modules with code splitting?
* [x] Dev & production config files
* [ ] HMR or workable live reload for both client and server
* [ ] Store properly injecting state with `devalue` on the server
* [ ] Implement `getInitialProps` on page components

## Intentional Tech Debt
* [ ] Preact Router utils should just be exposed through a fork of the actual `preact-router`
